      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="p-overview">We had to add a new feature in a well-known application, in my case WhatsApp. A new feature in WhatsApp to be able to ask questions type surveys in groups. It was a challenge because we had to incorporate the new functionality without changing the appearance of the current interface.</p>
    </sectio n>
    <section id="Whatsapp">
      <h2>WhatsApp</h2>
      <p>WhatsApp is free to download messenger app for smartphones. WhatsApp uses the internet to send messages, images, audio or video.</p>
      <p>Whatsapp had 1,500 million users in 2018</p>
      <p>In a minute, 38 million WhatsApp messages are sent.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="obj">
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>Incorporate new features into the existing platform based on user needs.</p>

    <section id="research">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>Task Analysis (6 people).</h3>
      <p>50% of respondents search the functionality of creating surveys in the kebab menu and the rest in the icon of adding files.</p>
      <h3>Poll ( 51 people).</h3>
      <p>96% of respondents have ever made a decision on WhatsApp.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They ask for the group.</li>
        <li>With lists.</li>
        <li>With external programs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="problem">
      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>The main problem is that users have no quick and easy way to create surveys efficiently.</p>
      <p>Its main competitor is Telegram, it already has a functionality to conduct surveys.</p>

      <h2>Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>"The questions end up being lost in the comments.</li>

        <li>"They take a long time to make a firm decision."</li>

    <section id="persona">
      <p>“There are always people who do not respond and then get upset by the decision we make”</p>
      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <h3>Frustrations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>That the questions and answers are lost.</li>
        <li>Having to waste so much time agreeing on something.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Motivations</h3>
      <p>Make a decision without problems within a WhatsApp group.</p>
      <h3>Needs</h3>
      <p>Know who has answered the survey.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="testing-1">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>The users were confused when I had to choose the duration of the interview, because it seemed very complex to use. I finally changed by default to facilitate user choice.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="testing-2">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Users had to make two different clicks, one to access the people who had voted and the other to see who was left to vote. Finally I decided that the best option would be to consult all this data in one click.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="nextsteps">
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to edit the surveys by the creator in case you want to add a new option or if there is an error in it.</li>
        <li>To be able to customize the duration of the survey simply and quickly.</li>
        <li>That users can change their surveys in case they want to change their response.</li>
